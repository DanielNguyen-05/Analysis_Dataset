    "## 1. Research Question 1: Unit Price Efficiency Analysis\n",
    "**The Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "How does the relationship between property size (`square_feet`) and unit price (`price_per_sqft`) vary across different BHK configurations (1, 2, 3, 4+) and area types (Super Area vs. Carpet Area)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically: Does a specific **\"area threshold\"** exist where increasing the square footage no longer results in a competitive unit price (diminishing returns), and does this threshold differ between BHK groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation & Benefits**\n",
    "* **Why this is worth investigating:** Real estate pricing is rarely linear. This analysis explores the \"Core Pricing Logic,\" verifying whether larger properties offer economies of scale or if there is a point of diminishing returns.\n",
    "* **Insights provided:** It identifies the \"sweet spot\" size for each apartment configuration (e.g., the optimal size for a 2BHK before it becomes overpriced relative to the market).\n",
    "* **Stakeholders:**\n",
    "    * **Home Buyers:** To identify \"value-for-money\" properties and avoid paying a premium for inefficiently large spaces.\n",
    "    * **Investors:** To maximize rental yield potential by purchasing efficiently sized units.\n",
    "    * **Real Estate Agents:** To justify pricing strategies to sellers based on market data.\n",
    "* **Real-world decision:** This informs the decision of choosing a property that offers the best utility-to-price ratio."

    "## 2. Research Question 2: Neighborhood Price Premium\n",
    "**The Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "After controlling for structural and listing attributes (e.g., `square_feet`, `bhk`, `areaWithType`, `transaction`, `status`, `furnishing`, and floor-related variables such as `floor`, `num_floor`), which localities in Surat exhibit statistically significant price premiums or discounts in `price_per_sqft`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, we will extract locality from property_name (e.g., “... in Dindoli Surat”) and estimate each locality’s adjusted premium/discount relative to the market baseline while holding other factors constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation & Benefits**\n",
    "* **Why this is worth investigating:** Location is typically the strongest driver of real-estate prices, but naive comparisons (e.g., mean price by locality) can be misleading because different localities may have different mixes of property types (BHK, size, furnishing level, etc.). We need an approach that isolates the “pure” location effect.\n",
    "* **Insights provided:** This analysis produces an evidence-based ranking of localities by adjusted price premium/discount, including uncertainty (confidence intervals). It reveals where price differences persist even after controlling for property attributes.\n",
    "* **Stakeholders:**\n",
    "    * **Home buyers**, **sellers**, **brokers/agents**, **investors**, and **property listing platforms** (pricing guidance, valuation, and anomaly detection).\n",
    "* **Real-world decision:** This informs the decision of choosing a property that offers the best utility-to-price ratio."

    "**Motivation & Benefits**\n",
    "* **Why this is worth investigating:** Average prices alone do not capture market stability. Two segments may share similar medians but have very different spreads: one is predictable (stable pricing), the other is volatile (hard\n",
    "to price, larger negotiation risk).\n",
    "* **Insights provided:** \n",
    "  * A clear ranking of “most volatile” vs “most stable” segments using an outlier-robust spread metric.\n",
    "  * Evidence on whether New and Resale markets differ in price dispersion for the same BHK size.\n",
    "* **Stakeholders:**\n",
    "    * Home buyers: understand where listing prices are less reliable and where negotiation may matter.\n",
    "    * Agents / listing platforms: provide price ranges (confidence bands) rather than single-point prices.\n",
    "    * Investors: identify segments with greater mispricing opportunities due to higher dispersion.\n",
    "* **Real-world decision:** “Should I trust listing prices in this segment, or do I need more comparable checks and stronger negotiation because the market is noisy?”"
